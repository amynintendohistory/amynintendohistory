<h2>Family Computer (1983)</h2>
<p>The Family Computer, also known as the Famicom, was released in 1983. It was Nintendoâ€™s first cartridge-based system. It launched their classic games and their trademark style of controller.</p>
<br>

<h2>Nintendo Entertainment System (1985)</h2>
<p>In 1985, the Nintendo Entertainment System, the American version of Famicom, was introduced to North America. North America was facing the Video Games Crash of 1983 which caused video games to be dead. The NES was sold with Robotic Rob to sneak the system into toy isles. The console was extremely popular and made Nintendo international.</p>
<br>

<h2>Game Boy (1989)</h2>
<p>In 1989, the Game Boy was the first successful, portable console created by Gunpei Yokoi. He was on a train when he saw someone playing with their calculator. He then came up with the idea of the Game Boy. It had a cartridge-based concept and the controller style of the NES (IGN, 2017). Later on, different variations of the Game Boy were created like the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Pocket, etc.</p>
