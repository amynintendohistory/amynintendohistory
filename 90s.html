<h1>Consoles of the 1990's</h1>
<div class="container">
<h2>Virtual Boy (1995)</h2>
<p>The Virtual Boy, created by Yokoi, is considered the worst console produced by Nintendo. In 1995, Nintendo was starting to play with the idea of virtual reality. Unfortunately, they were ahead of their time. The system was only in red and black, just in 3D, had a small library of games, and caused headaches and nausea. Also, it wasn’t detachable because Nintendo was afraid that they would be liable if someone were to injury themselves. Meaning that the user had to bend their neck to look through which was extremely uncomfortable. The console didn’t sell well and was discontinued in less than a year. It ruined the relationship between Yokoi and Nintendo. Following the console’s failure, he quietly resigned.

<h2>Nintendo 64 (1996)</h2>
<p> The Nintendo 64, released in 1996, was the first console to allow 4 controller ports which enabled multiplayer. It emphasized polygon graphics with 3D games. It also offered good games like Super Mario 64 and Donkey Kong Country. </p>
