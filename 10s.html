<h1>Consoles of the 2010's</h1>
<div class="container">
<h2>Nintendo 3DS (2011)</h2>
<p>In 2011, Nintendo produced the 3DS. Compare to the DS, it had a 3D effect added to its 800 x 240 px upper screen. This allowed games to be view in 3D without 3D glasses. Also, it had an analog circle pad and online features. The hardware was more advanced than the DS.</p>
<br>

<h2>Wii U (2012)</h2>
<p>The Wii U was released in 2012. It had a large controller with a centered touch-screen. Wii games and accessories were compatible with the console. Although it was the first console with HD graphics and had good games like Super Mario 3D World, it wasnâ€™t marketed well. Initially, people were confused about the console itself. Most people thought it was an add-on for its predecessor, the Wii. It also had a limited-range for mobile play.</p>
<br>

<h2>Nintendo 2DS (2013)</h2>
<p>The 2DS came out in 2013. It was initially aimed at a younger audience, but grew popular to all. It was similar to 3DS, but without the 3D. Nintendo were worried about potential eye concerns (experts believe it was to avoid liability reasons).
</p>
<br>

<h2>Nintendo Switch (2017)</h2>
<p>Released in 2017, the Nintendo Switch was considered a success due to the Wi U's shortcomings. The tablet-like console had two detachable controllers. The system slides into a dock connecting to a TV. It can also be used for portable play.
